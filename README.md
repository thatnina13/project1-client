Tic Tac Tina is a single page application which, ideally, allows a user to create an account, sign in, play a game, play multiple games and retrieve their gaming history. 
In order to being playing, a user must click the Start game button. This will allow the game board to become clickable. The first move will place an X, and the following move will place an O. The user, prompted my messaging, will continue to place the alternating character on the board until there is either a winning combination or a tie. Upon a win of either X or O, the user will see a message confirming the winner. Should the game end in a tie, the user will be show a message announcing the outcome as a tie. 
Technologies used in this project are as follows: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP

Background
This project was my own personal hell. It was a hell which I revisited four separate times as I restarted the game logic four times. Unfortunately it wasn't until the fourth time that I realized there was a...method...to my madness. (That's a little coding joke, there as no method- just pure insanity and frustration. Each time I went back to the drawing board, I found myself stuck and bogged down by the gamePlay function- that big nasty beast of a function that calls all the other functions and actually allows the game to work. 

I was incredibly lucky throughout this ordeal. Lucky to have great instructors and lucky to have fantastic classmates. Had it not been for the folks helping me, I would never have made it this far. I began with a large pile of note cards and a very convoluted user story- Mike was good enough to help me trim it down to a more concise and MVP friendly narrative. Please see the original user stories below, accompanied by wire framing.  
As a user, I decide-hey, maybe it's time to freshen up my tick tac toe skills
I arrive onsite
I sign up with my email and a brand new, never before been used password cause I'm sort of into security
Once I'm logged in, I Click on the create new game button
Jacked up to start playing myself, I kick things off my placing an X
Then I place and O
Eventually I win or tie
I decide I want a new game, Who wouldn't this game is so fun, it's bananas 
I click on the button to start a new game
I play game after game till my heart is content 
Seven hours later, having had my full of tic tac toe- I decide it's probably time I take my dog out.
I sign out.
